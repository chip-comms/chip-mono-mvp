    "fullText": "So, this has been a mess the past five minutes. So I'm sorry, let me read you, let me read you just. It is nice to reconnect. And I do want to chat at some point about just like life and work. The thing that I really wanted to talk to you about is Florence has its ups and downs. I'm really frustrated. I basically was told last week that there's no growth for me at Florence. So I'm evaluating new business ideas as well as like, just like one like looking out into the world to see what's there. But also I have an idea that I'm exploring. So I think I thought you'd be a good person to talk to. - Sure. - Yeah. So the gist of the idea actually kind of comes from my work at Florence. We've done a ton of those discovery interviews with one of the conversations that use our research. And a lot of times it just goes into a page on confluence. And the only times that other people use any of the work that we do is if, or that we have created is if we create some sort of insights from our own work and give it to them. So the idea is we can create a sort of documentation system using AI as well as a like CRM, like a sales CRM specifically for user research so that it kind of automates all of the time (indistinct) people to talk to, scheduling them, recording them and then we take those transcripts to do like an AI analysis. Maybe we can create some persona based chatbots so that everyone on the company could say, if you joined like, we'll use Florence to the example because we both know it is like, okay, someone doesn't understand clinical researcher or doesn't understand clinical research. We're here, you can go talk to a clinical researcher without having to actually go talk to someone. So we can kind of create these reuse the data that we've already created. - That exists already. - Okay. - Maybe not exactly how you're envisioning and I have an idea because of like the communication but Dovetail's been around for quite a moment. - Yeah. - And Dovetail basically it records with you tags, you who set up tags of like keywords that are important for your industry or your research and it will tag your research, practice whether it's a transcript or whether it's a video and it will automatically tag your research to when those keywords show up. And you know, so you can go and so you're saying, okay, well, I'm looking for research on source documentation. So it will actually show you every time source documents comes up in any research that you have done. - Gotcha. Okay. So that does it searches through those transcripts and like we'll pull those things up? - It automatically tags it for you. - Oh, okay. And then it does it search through the transcripts as well or wow. Okay. So when we were doing our competitive analysis, Dovetail seemed like it was more about retrieval, right? But not necessarily the analysis or like it couldn't, does it do any sort of like semantic analysis or like, oh, you talked to these people and this is these are the major things that they're saying. - That one doesn't, there's a new one coming out. - Ah. - Like this AI base that does that more and I don't remember the name of it, but I just saw it and I was gonna send it to my head of research 'cause we just got Dovetail approved and I was gonna set it to head of research but he already doesn't like me. So I- - Why? - I find that hard to believe. - Because he thinks that I am he thinks that I am impeding on his expertise. - Of course. - And it's just the way that he has never worked, he from his training is not a designer. He is by training a project manager and had worked on construction project management for a great number of years. He has been with the company for over 15 years. He learned user research and he's good at very structured user research. I don't have any problem with him, but I don't think he understands the overlap and the collaboration of it. I think he's a little bit more of the mind that he's in charge. And I also think that he's been there a really long time. So he doesn't like, I think he's also very territorial. - Yeah. - So that's a him problem, not a me problem. - Yeah, that's okay. That might be the only, I would have assumed that anyone who wouldn't have liked it would have been more of a them problem. - And I don't have a problem with him, but he's, but also for somebody so research minded and research focused, who claims to be very unbiased, he's extremely biased. - So is the user, I guess like what's the breakdown of the types of user research that you're doing? Like what percent is like one-on-one conversations versus like surveys versus like usability tests or beta tests? - All I think you say, you're doing all of them. - All of it, we have a team. You have a team to do it. What, we have four researchers. We do market analysis. We do VO, VOC, yeah, we do competitive analysis. We do, we even have like scorecards. So we can look at all the competitors and have scorecards for each of the competitors. Like yeah, we're kind of doing it all. - And do you have a good idea of like how many people you guys are talking to for the like one-on-one? - Our researchers talk to anywhere between, they do a standard VO cross-company monthly between the three different sets of, we have SMB, which is not exactly SMB because it's actually just small business. Medium is actually separate, even though they call it small SMB, it drives me correct. So it's basically SMB mid-market and then like the large, I forget what we call the larger group. Yeah, so we do VO-O across everybody that works on those levels. Basically go through the roadmap, go through everything that they're hearing in a forum for all of product and research, all product really to hear what sales is saying. So we do it as a group. It's more of like an internal community gathering of to hear what those researchers have found. - No, it's the opposite. It is a, it is a, researchers running it, but it is a product hosted event where all of our sales and customer representatives for each of those groups joins in to tell us what they're hearing. - And those representatives are the sales reps or they're-- - They could be sales. They could be customer service. They could be like, so that's also cross-functional. It's literally like customer facing people coming in that deal with that market segment to tell us what they're hearing. Just an open forum to basically as the eyes and the ears. So we know, if we need to dig into stuff, we know what to dig into and we know what they're up against. And the researchers, like are they also doing those one-on-one interviews in between those months and then providing that? - So they can. So that's just like the standard cadence of just like standard VOO for the organization. On top of that, like we did, we were working on, there's a ticket called reduce confusion where we, you know, some of our workflows are a little funky. And so, and we know that they're funky. We kind of know how they're funky a little bit, but we wanted to get better ideas. So we had a VOO, which is voice of the organization and then there's VOC, which is voice of the customer. I think those might be terms that people use in other companies too. That's why I want to call them out because they're, I think they're good terminology. - Yeah. - So we do, we can do like small like focus group VOs. So we were talking about like our saved searches, which essentially a saved filter set and tagging is very confusing in our system. So we did a, we did a VOO just around that topic. So we'll have one off ones with a small group of people that deal with maybe that functionality and also do additional research to do a deep dive on the subject. We can do that talk and we do it all the time. On top of that, we will also do VOC because we don't want to just listen to our VOO. - Okay. And the V, your VOCs, are those typically ad hoc as well or are they on a cadence? - They're on an initiative. So we'll have a ticket, I'll tell a researcher what I want researched. And then I will work with them to create a field guide and then they will go and conduct the research and invite me into the research that they conduct. - Do you know if they, do you know how they find the people that they're gonna talk to and do you? - Gain site. - What do you mean insight? - Gain site. We use gain site, not so you use Pendo. So gain site, we just get them right from gain site. - And the gain site is product data. - Okay. Okay, get. - And what we do is we have an ongoing thing within our products, help us with research. We're allowed to give an Amazon gift card. People don't do it for the gift card. Honestly, nobody really cares. I've had, we've had people just tell us to keep it. Like, so I don't, I wouldn't put too much stress on that because nobody's doing user research for that $10 gift card. - Yeah, in our competitive analysis, there's a company called User Research and you literally just pay that 50 bucks for every interview. And like we were having the conversation of like, do people actually like, like, what makes a good research subject? And then also like, why do they find value in it? At Florence, people don't really care about like, we've given, find our Starbucks gift cards. People, they don't give a shit. Or like, we've tried to give money, but they just want to make the product better for them. - It doesn't work for SaaS. It doesn't matter for SaaS. - Yeah, okay. - So when you're, if you have a direct-to-consumer product, that $50 makes a difference. And you're going to get, and you're also going to get a lot of low-level users that probably don't use your product. I'm going to give you an example. So in between jobs, several years ago, I did, I was an extra for different movies and stuff, okay? So when you go on that, there's people who are like professional extras, and they're not all people who want to be actors. Some of them just like the flexibility to just want to work when they want to, and turn it down when they want to. - Yeah. - Or they just can't get another job. So a lot of these people, while they're sitting there, will go on to Nielsen and do surveys for money. So, and these are people who may not be the product users, and also may not be, but they're doing it to get that 20, $50. - That totally makes sense. - So, yeah. So just to give you an idea, but I think B2B SaaS, even B2C SaaS, I just don't. Do you talk to, I would agree with all that. Do you, only, or I guess your researchers only ever talk to users, or do they ever talk to non-users who may be using similar products? - It's usually users, but all of our users are not buyers. So our product is free for a lot of users, and a lot of our users don't, aren't gonna buy. We will talk to all users. So it's, which I think that makes, gives that a little, because so basically like, they're not all fans of ours. Is the reason why I say that. - And the, because the buyers are typically fans of you. - The buyers have a reason to be in there. The users are not, are not always fans of ours, because like we do a lot of heavy marketing, which I think actually is not great for us. I think we hit 'em over the head with marketing, and it's not great. And our onboarding experience was a 10-step process, which was awful, and the thing is, is that they may be going through that 10-step process, just to get an invitation to bid on a project. Okay, like the person who's just getting an ITB who's gonna use us once to log into the creative account, just because this guy sent me a project. - Yeah. - Just, just, just, just email it to me. Like, I don't care, you know, download it. Like, so, yeah. (both laughing) - Are there, when you said that project plan to your research, is there ever times where they say, \"Hey, we don't have people to talk to,\" or, \"We're struggling to get enough?\" - They, they, we have more of an issue of them not showing up and just being busy. I don't know that they've, they have that much of an issue, not getting research subjects. I think, I think Florence puts more, throttles us more than they should. I also don't think Florence has the access to the data they need to know who the customers are. - Yeah. - I think it's a little bit of both. I think CS throttles that information, and I think, you know. - Yeah. - And I don't think that's necessarily a unique problem, but I consider that a management decision problem, more than a functional problem. - Yeah. So, you said you just got dovetail. - We're guiding it. We're getting dovetail and we're getting maze. - Maze? Okay. - Mm-hmm. - What's, what is maze? - I mean, I almost used it at, at, at, at, at Cognia too. It is for user testing, for, product testing. - Okay. So, I'm wondering, I guess what I, what I'm curious is like, the way that I see the user research world is like, there's like the qualitative stuff that you can do typically in surveys. Not every organization has like an established user research work, right? - Yes, but I gotta say. - You think they do? - Most, like honestly, ours was not, you know, we didn't really have one. Nor was it really, nor will they really supportive of us being one. - Oh. - Yeah. - Was not supportive of, of Florence. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I think, if you don't have one, that is why. - Yeah. - I don't, again, I think it's more of, I think it really falls into a management decision that they are, they do not welcome feedback, not that people cannot get feedback. I think that is the problem. - Yeah. - Okay. - Does anybody can do user research? It does not have to come from UX. It does not have to come from product. If you want feedback, the customer experience people could be easily doing all the research you need in a small organization. - Yeah, it's interesting. I think that what I hear from other, what I've heard from other people that I've interviewed is there's like a couple categories of like, one, it's hard to, especially it's smart companies. Maybe this is kind of the outcome of what our conversation is. Like, if we approach a point where a company gets large enough, that dovetail makes sense. Is dovetail pretty expensive, do you know? - I don't think it is, actually. Let me check. And I will try to look up that other, that new AI one, because actually to me, it looked better than dovetail. - Was it insight seven? - No. - Okay. - Yeah, let me see, pricing. What is dovetail's pricing? It's free for like a single user. Oh, you got one project, one channel, unlimited users. So professional is $29 a month. - Okay, so yeah, not that expensive. - It's not expensive. - Yeah, okay. Except for that, and the enterprise one, who knows how expensive that is. But like, if you're a small team, $29, is it anything? - No, there's nothing. Do you, well, I guess you're going to get dovetail at some point. I'd be curious to hear how it goes once you start using it. And then if there's, are there any other gaps, do you think in your user research that you had more access, that would give you maybe more access to customer feedback or input? - Yeah, I guess, another thing too, is that like we're using air table to hold all the information, which I also think that's helpful. I think that confluence is not the place at all. But I think something like an air table or even like a notion. - Yeah. - You know, it's just inherently better. And if you actually have dovetail, I don't know if it integrates or not, but even if it doesn't integrate, if you have them tagged in the same manner. - Yeah. - You've solved so many of your problems. - 100%, 100%. Well, this has been helpful. I really appreciate you giving me your feedback. - Yeah. - Yeah. Let me look at my notes real quick. There's any other questions. - Is dovetail going to help you do, like as you said, no, it won't do any of the analysis to help like determine? - I don't know how much of it it does. Let me see. It does integrate with tools. So I guess it is going to, and it does track feedback. Channels is a new way to transform feedback into powerful insights, uncover trends, predict issues and build products people love. So they are doing that. That is a new feature that's coming out for them. - Do you know if your marketing team would potentially use something like dovetail with your data in it so they could test like messaging and like... - They already do that. - They already do that. - Yeah. Marketing doesn't, marketing is as always more nimble than product. So marketing does test messaging and does quite about a lot of A, B and A, B, C experiments with different messaging and with different kind of layouts. - Do you feel, yeah, that makes sense. Do you know if you think it could be faster for them if they had access to the data that you'll have in dovetail? - We have gain sight. That's the thing is that like, I feel like where you're missing a connection point is actually the fact that you have bad analytics. - Yeah, totally. - So I think you have, if you have your analytic platform hooked up with your database with your, like if you have these things working together, you have a much better view of what's happening. - Yeah. - Florence were, Florence were very, we were very hampered by it. And it all comes up like our own shitty data to begin with. - Yeah, yeah. - You don't even want to hear the shit that's been happening this past year. And you don't even want to know. No, this is very good. And this is, I mean, this is why I'm doing these calls, it's to know, it's to learn what I don't know. So I really appreciate it. Let me see. Oh, could you just look up the, could you send me the link for maze and that other thing that you? - Yeah, I'll look for the other thing maze. I can probably go up to you right now. - Please. - But yeah, this also makes me wonder like maybe like, I'm thinking about this obviously from what Florence is the only like software company that I really have experience at. I'm thinking about this from the Florence perspective. Like maybe we just have to segment this specifically for teams that have mature products. - I feel like, I feel like even, I feel like nobody's data is great. I feel like Florence is particularly terrible. - Yeah. - It is uniquely terrible. - Yeah. - And the fact that they have not done more to make it not terrible is gonna sink them. And I, that's been apparent for a long time and they're not making good decisions. - Yeah, yeah, no, 100%. It's like annoying and it's like, I agree that we do weigh too much marketing, but it's like, that's like the biggest, I, in my opinion, like the biggest problem is like marketing makes everyone direct the cool aid. And like, for some reason, like we have such a great brand across the industry. I asked a random person, like, who's the best product? Who makes the best product in clinical research? They're like, oh Florence, buy a mile. And I'm like, how is Florence the best product in clinical trials? And we have such shit stuff. - It's awful. And it was funny too, is I think you really need to have, I talked, I had my annual visit with my nephrologist today and I had mentioned Florence and he was like, Italy, he's like, never heard of it. And he's, I mean, he conducts, he's, he is an investigator. Like he did, like he, I had the drug I take volaticep, he ran that study with one of the other, with the lead researcher, but he actually led the study at Emory and he's done several other trials and he's got a relationship with Bristol Myers. - Interesting. - And they're not a client. So I just thought that was interesting. - Yeah. - I'm just saying. - No, you're so right. I'm trying to get off this horn ship as soon as possible. - You know, I think should position just, please, I would position yourself as a user researcher and not as a product person. - Okay. - Because I think that's where you're, I think that in reality is what your skill said, what, like what your job is. - Yeah. - 100%. - Yeah. I think product strategy is going to be, is going to not resonate given your experience with other companies. I think user research, you will actually have a lot of experience in actually the very, very, you know, people will be, you know. - What would be, should I use like user research or should I use voice to the customer? - User research is the category. Voice of the customer is one of the types of research you do. - Ah, okay, okay. - Yeah. And if you have questions, I'm happy to like help you. - Yeah. - But I think, I think you are, you're a researcher. - Yeah. - Like you, and you have good experience in research and you know, and you're, yeah, that's, to me. - No, you're right. I said that to Andrew last week, she made a pretty insulting comment that was like, how do you feel that you don't have any like, transferable skills, like any deep expertise in anything, going to find your next job? And I was like, well, I would argue I had deep expertise in user research, like it's fine. - Yeah, I think you could easily, I would position your current position as a user researcher, roll and just try to transition that into another one. - Yeah, into another user research, not into product management. - I think you need something in between, if you wanna go into product management. - Okay. - I think you can, but I think, I actually think you're gonna have to come onto the UX side before you could go to the product side. - Gotcha. - Yeah, it's good advice. - Yeah, because essentially, you usually don't start in a strategic role. You start as a, you know, BAPO. - Yeah. - And then go up to PM and then go into strategy. And then you become, you go from like a tactical PM to like a strategic PM. - Yeah. - Goes with like your layers in the organization. People don't usually hire, you know, somebody who has a few years experience as a strategist with no other role. - Yeah. - And you don't just walk into those. - Yeah. - But user research is a very strategic role that can easily roll into a PM role. - Yeah, yeah. - No, that's good advice. That is really good advice. Well, Lauren, thank you. I'll have to say to my resume if I start, if I start applying other places and I'd love your opinion. So thank you. - Thank you. Have a good one. - All right, see you later. - Bye. - Bye.",
