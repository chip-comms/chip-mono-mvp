FULL TRANSCRIPT
================================================================================

So this has been a mess the past five minutes. So I'm sorry, let me read, read, read just, um, it is nice to reconnect. And I do want to, want to chat at some point, um, about just like life and work. The, the one, the thing that I really wanted to talk to you about is, um, Florence has its ups and downs. I'm really frustrated. I basically was told last week that there's no growth for me at Florence. So I'm evaluating new business ideas as well as like, just like, well, I'm like looking out into the, into the world to see what's there. But also, um, I have an idea that I'm exploring, um, so I think I thought you'd be a good person to talk to. Sure. Yeah. So the gist of the idea, uh, actually kind of comes from my work at Florence. We've done a ton of those discovery interviews with one one conversation that use our research and a lot of times it just goes into a page on confluence and the only times that other people use any of the work that we do is if, or that we have created is if we create some sort of insights from our own work and give it to them. So the idea is we can create a sort of, um, documentation system using AI, um, as well as a, like CRM, like a sale CRM specifically for user research so that it kind of automates all of the time, people to talk to, scheduling them, recording them, and then we take those transcripts to do like an AI analysis. Maybe we can create some persona based chatbots, uh, so that everyone on the company could say, you know, if you joined, like, we'll use for example, because we both know it is like, okay, someone doesn't understand clinical researcher or doesn't understand clinical research. We're here, you can go talk to a clinical researcher without having to actually go talk to someone, um, so we can kind of create these, um, reuse the data that we've already created. That exists already. Okay. Like, for like, maybe not exactly how you're envisioning and I have an idea because of like the communication, but dovetail's been around from, for, for quite a moment. Yeah. Um, and dovetail, um, basically it records with you tags, you who set up tags of like the keywords that are, that are important for, um, your industry or your research. And it will tag your, um, your, uh, research, uh, you know, practice whether it's a transcript or whether it's a video and it will automatically tag your research to win those keywords show up. Um, and, and, you know, so, so you can go and, so you're saying, okay, well, I'm looking for, um, uh, research on source documentation. So it will actually show you every time source documents comes up in any research that you have done. Gotcha. Okay. So that does it, it searches through those transcripts and like we'll pull those things up. It automatically tags it for you. Oh. Okay. And then it doesn't search through the transcripts as well. Or wow. Okay. Moving our competitive analysis, dovetail seemed like it was more about retrieval, right? But not necessarily the analysis or like it couldn't, does it do any sort of like semantic analysis? Like, Oh, you talked to these people and this is, these are the major things that they're saying. That one doesn't, there's a new one coming out AI base that does that more. And I don't remember the name of it, but I just saw it and I was going to send it to my head of research, cause we just got dovetail approved and I was going to set it to head of research, but he already doesn't like me. So I, why I find that hard to believe because, um, he thinks that I am, um, uh, he thinks that I am impeding on his expertise. And it's just the way that he has never, he, he from his, uh, training is not a designer. He is by training a project manager and had worked on construction project management for, for a great number of years. He has been with the company for over 15 years, um, he learned user research and he's good at very structured user research. Um, I don't have any problem with him, but I don't think he understands the overlap and the, um, how in the collaboration of it, I think he's a little bit more of the mind that he's in charge. And I also think that he's been there a really long time. So he doesn't like, I think he's also very territorial. Yeah. So that's a hand problem, not a me problem. Yeah. That's okay. I would have assumed that anyone who wouldn't have liked it would have been more of a, of them problems. And I don't have a problem with him, but he's, but, but also for somebody so, uh, research minded and research focused who's, who claims to be very unbiased, he's extremely biased. So is the user, what, I guess like, what's the breakdown of the types of user research that you're doing? What percent is like one on one conversations versus like surveys versus like usability tests or beta tests, you do it all of them. All of it. We have a team. You have a team to do it. What, uh, give more researchers. We do, we do market analysis. We do V O O V O C. Um, we, yeah, we do competitive analysis. We do, um, uh, we even have like scorecards. So we can look at all the competitors and have scorecards for each of the competitors. Like, yeah, we're kind of doing it all. Um, and do you, do you have a good idea of like how many people you guys are talking to for the like one on one, uh, our researchers talk to any, but anywhere between, they do, they do a standard V O O cross cross company, uh, monthly between the three different sets of, we have SMB, which is not exactly SMB because it's actually just small business medium is actually separate, even though they call small SMB it drives me correct. Um, so it's basically SMB mid market and then like, um, the, the large, I forget what we call the, the larger, um, yeah. So we do V O O across everybody that works on those levels. Um, basically go through the roadmap, go through everything that they're hearing in a forum for, for all of product and research, uh, all of product, really, um, to hear what sales is saying. So we do it as a group. Um, it's more of like a, an internal community gathering of to hear what those researchers have found. No, it's the opposite. It is a, it is a, it is a, researchers running it, but it is a product hosted event where all of our, um, sales and customer representatives for each of those groups joins in to tell us what they're hearing. And those representatives are the sales reps or they're, they could be sales. They could be customer service. They could be like, so that's, it's also cross functional. It's literally like customer facing people coming in that deal with that market segment to tell us what they're hearing, um, you know, just in an open forum, you know, to, to, to, to basically as the eyes and the ears, um, so we know, if we need to dig into stuff, we know what to dig into and we know what to hear, what they're up against. And the, the researchers, like, are they also doing those one on one interviews in between those months and then providing that? So they can. So, so that's just like the standard cadence of just like standard VOO for the organization. Okay. On top of that, like we did, um, we were working on, um, there's a ticket called reduce confusion where we, you know, some of our workflows are a little funky. And so, and we know that they're funky. We kind of know how they're funky a little bit, but we wanted to get better ideas. So we had a VOO, which is voice of the organization. And then there's VOC, which is voice of the customer. I think those might be terms that people use in other companies to use. That's why I want to call them out because they're, I think they're good terminology. Yeah. Um, so we do, we can do like small, like focus group VOs. So we were talking about like our saved searches, which essentially is safe filter set. Um, and tagging is very confusing in our system. So we did a, we did a VOO just around that topic. So we'll have one off ones with a small group of people that deal with maybe that functionality and also do additional research to do deep dive on a subject. We can do that talk and we do it all the time. Um, on top of that, we will also do VOC, um, because we don't want to just listen to our VOO. Okay. And the V, uh, your VOCs, are they, are those typically ad hoc as well? Or are they on a cadence? They're, they're on an initiative. So we'll have a ticket, you'll, I'll, I'll tell a researcher what I want researched. Um, they will, and then I will work with them to create a field guide and then they will go and conduct a research and invite me into the research that they conduct. Uh, do you know if they, how like, do you know how they find the people that they're going to talk to? And do you? Gain site. What do you mean insight? Gain site. We use gain site, not, so you use Pendo. So gain site. We just get it right, get them right from gain site. And the gain site is product data. Okay. Uh, okay, get, uh, and what they, what we do is we have, we have an ongoing thing within our products help us with research. We're allowed to give an Amazon gift card. People don't do it for the gift card. Honestly, nobody really cares. Um, I've had, we've had people just tell, tell us to keep it like, yeah, I, I don't, I wouldn't put too much stress on that because nobody's doing user research for that $10 gift card. Yeah. In, in our competitive analysis, there's a, there's a company called user research. And you literally just pay that 50 bucks for every interview. And like we were having the conversation of like, do people actually like, like, what makes a good use, a good research subject? And then also like, why do, like, why do they find value in it at Florence? People don't really care about like we've given, find our Starbucks gift cards. People, they don't, they don't give a shit or like, we've tried to give money, but they just want to make the product better for them. It doesn't work for SaaS. It doesn't matter for SaaS. Yeah. And so when you're, if you have a direct to consumer product, that $50 makes a difference and you're going to get, and you're also going to get a lot of, um, low level, um, users that probably don't use your product. I'm going to give you an example. So in between jobs, several years ago, I did, um, I was a extra for different movies and stuff. So, when you go on that, but there's people who are like professional extras and they're not all people who want to be actors. Some of them just like the flexibility to just want to work when they want to and turn it down when they want to. Yeah. So, or they just can't get another job. So a lot of these people while they're, they're sitting there, will go on to Nielsen and do surveys for money, uh, so, and, and these are people who may not be the product users and also may not be, I, but they're doing it to get that 20, $50, um, that totally makes sense. So, yeah. So just to give you an idea of, but I think B2B SaaS, even B2C SaaS, I just don't. Do you talk to, I would agree with all that, do you, um, only, or I guess your researchers only ever talk to users or do they ever talk to non-users who may be using similar products? Um, it's usually users, but all of our users are not, um, buyers. So our product is free for a lot of users and a lot of our users don't aren't going to buy. We will talk to all users. So it's, which I think that makes, gives that a little bit because, so basically like, they're not all, um, fans of ours. Uh, is the reason why I say that, because the buyers are typically fans of you. The buyers have a reason to be in there. The users are not, are not always fans of ours because like, we do a lot of heavy marketing, which I think actually is not great for us. Um, I think we, we, we hit them over the head with marketing and it's, it's, it's not great. And we, our onboarding experience was a 10 step process, which was awful. Yeah. And the thing is, is that they may be going through that 10 step process just to get an invitation to bid on a project. Mm. Okay. Like the person, the person who's just getting an ITB who's going to use us once, yeah, the log to create an account just because this guy sent me a project. Yeah. Just, just, just, just email it to me. Like I don't care, you know, download it, like, yeah, are there a, when you said that project plan to your research, is there ever times where they say, hey, we don't have people to talk to or, or we're, we're struggling to get enough. Um, they, they, we have more of an issue of them not showing up and just being busy. Um, I, I don't know that they, they, they have that much of an issue not getting research subjects. I think, I think Florence puts more, uh, throttles us more than they should. I also don't think Florence has the access to the data they need to know who the customers are. Yeah. A little bit of both. I think CS throttles that information. And I think, you know, yeah, and I don't think that's necessarily a unique problem. But I consider that a management decision problem more than a, um, functional problem. Yeah. So you, you said you just got dovetail. Um, we're guiding it. We're getting ducktail and we're getting maze maze. Okay. Uh, what's it? What is maze? I mean, um, I almost used it at, uh, at, uh, at, uh, at cognitive too. It is, um, for user testing for, um, product testing. Okay. So I'm wondering, I guess what I, um, what I'm curious is like the way that I see the user research world is like, there's like the qualitative stuff that you can do typically in surveys, not every organization has like an established user research work. Right. Yes. But, uh, I got to say you think they do most like honestly, ours was very, ours was not, um, you know, we didn't really have one nor was it really, um, nor will they really supportive of us being one? Oh, why was not supportive of Florence for me? Yeah. Yeah. I think, um, if you don't have one, that is why. Yeah. I don't, I, again, I think it's more of, I think it really falls into a management decision that they are, they do not welcome feedback, not that people cannot get feedback. I think that is the problem. Yeah. Okay. Cause anybody can do user research. It does not have to come from UX. It does not have to come from product. Um, if you want feedback, the customer experience people could be, could be easily doing all the research you need in a small organization. Yeah. I, it's interesting. I think that what I hear from other, what I've heard from other people that I've interviewed is there's like a couple categories of like one, it's hard to, if you're, especially it's smart companies, maybe this is kind of the outcome of what our conversation is. Like, if we approach a point where a company gets large enough, that dovetail makes sense. Is dovetail pretty expensive? Do you know? I don't think it is. Actually. Let me check. And I, I will try to look up that other, that new AI one, because actually to me, it looked better than dovetail. Was it insight seven? No. Okay. Uh, yeah, um, let me see, pricing, what is dovetail's pricing? Uh, it's free for like a single user, uh, oh, you get one project, one channel unlimited users. So, so professional is $29 a month. Okay. So yeah, not that expensive. It's not expensive. Yeah. Okay. Um, except for the enterprise one, who knows how expensive that is, but like if you're a small team, $29 is it, is it anything? Um, do you, I guess you're, you're going to get dovetail at some point. I'd be curious to hear how it, how it goes, uh, once you start using it. And then if there's, are there any other gaps, do you think in your user research that you had more access that would give you maybe more access to customer feedback or input? Um, yeah, I guess another thing too, is that like, we're using air table to. Hold all the information, which I also think that's helpful. I think that, um, uh, confluence is not, is not the place at all, but I think something like an air table or even like a notion. Yeah. Um, you know, it's just inherently better. And if you actually have dovetail, I don't know if it integrates or not, but even if it doesn't integrate, if you have them tagged in the same manner, yeah, you've solved so many of your problems, 100%, 100%, well, this has been helpful. I really appreciate you giving me your feedback. Yeah. Yeah. Um, let me look at my notes real quick. There's any other questions, um, is dovetail going to help you do like, as you said, no, it won't do any of the analysis to help like determine? I don't know how much of it it does. Um, let me see. It does integrate with tools. So I guess it is going to, um, and it does track feedback channels is a new way to transform feedback into powerful insights, uncover trends, predict issues and build products people love. So they are doing that. That is a new feature that's coming out for them. Um, do you know, if. If your marketing team would potentially use something like dovetail with your data in it so they could test like messaging and like, say, already do that. They already do that. Okay. Yeah. Marketing doesn't, marketing is as always more nimble than product. So, um, marketing does, uh, test messaging and, and, and does quite about a lot of A, B and ABC, um, uh, experiments for, with different messaging and with different, um, kind of layouts. Do you feel? Yeah. That, that makes sense. Do you know if, do you think it could be faster for them if they had access to the data that you'll have in dovetail? We have gain sight. That's the thing is that like, I feel like where you're missing, uh, a, a connection point is actually the fact that you have bad analytics. Yeah. Totally. I think you have, if you have your analytic platform hooked up with your database with your, like, if you have these things working together, you're, you have a much better view of what's happening. Yeah. Florence were, Florence were very, we were very, um, uh, hampered bias and it all comes up like our own shitty data to begin with. Yeah. Yeah. You don't even want to hear the shit that's been happening this past year and you don't even want to know, uh, no, this is very good. And this is, I mean, this is why I'm doing these calls is to know, it's to learn what I don't know. So I really appreciate it. Um, let me see, uh, oh, could you just look up the, could you send me the, the link for maze and that other thing that you, yeah, I'll look for the other thing maze. I can probably give it to you right now, um, these, um, yeah, this also makes you wonder like maybe like I'm thinking about this, obviously from what Florence is the only like software company that I really have experience at. Yeah. I think about this from the Florence perspective, like maybe we just have to segment this specifically for teams that have mature products, uh, I feel like I feel like even, I feel like nobody's data is great. I feel like Florence is particularly terrible. Yeah. It is uniquely terrible. Yeah. And the fact that they have not done more to make it not terrible, um, is going to sink them. And I, that's, that's been apparent for a long time and they're not making good decisions. Yeah. Yeah. No, 100%. It's like, I agree that we do way too much marketing, but it's like, that's like the biggest, I, in my opinion, like the biggest problem is like marketing makes everyone direct the cool aid and like for some reason, like we have such a great brand across the industry. I asked a random person like who's the best product, who makes the best products in clinical research. They're like, Oh, Florence by a mile and I'm like, how is Florence the best product in clinical trials? When we have such stuff, it's, it's awful. And, and it's funny too, is I think you really need to have, I talked, I had my annual visit with my nephrologist today. And I had mentioned Florence and he was like, Italy, he's like never heard of it. And, and he's, I mean, he, he conducts, he's, he, he is an investigator, ah, like he did, like he, I had the drug, I take a lot of stuff. He ran that study with, um, one of the other, um, with the lead researcher, but he actually led the study, yeah, at Emory, and, um, he's done several other trials and he's got a relationship with Bristol Myers. Interesting. And they're not a client. So I just thought that was interesting. Yeah. I'm just, just saying. No, you're so right. I'm trying to get off this partnership as soon as possible. Uh, you know, I think should position just a little place, um, I would position yourself as a user researcher and not as a product person. Okay. Because I think that's where you're, I think that in reality is what your skill said. What, like, what your job is. Yeah. Um, yeah, I think product strategy is going to be, is going to not resonate given your experience with other companies. I think user research, you will actually, um, have a lot of experience in actually, um, the very, very, um, uh, you know, people would be, you know, what it be, should I use, like user research, or should I use voice of the customer? User research is the category. Um, voice of the customer is, is, is one of the types of research you do. Uh, okay. Okay. Yeah. And if, if you have questions, I'm happy to like help you. Yeah. But I think, I think you are, you're, you're a researcher. Yeah. More like you, and you, and you have good experience and research and, you know, you, and you're, yeah, that's, that's to me, you're right. I said that to, I said that to Andrew last week, she made a pretty, uh, insulting comment. That was like, how do you feel that you don't have any of like transferable skills, like any deep expertise in anything going to find your next job? And I was like, well, I would argue I had deep expertise in user research. Yeah. I, I, I think you could easily, I would, I would position your current position as a user researcher role and just try to transition that into another one. Yeah. I think you need something in between, if you want to go into product management. Okay. Okay. I think you, I think you can, um, but I think I actually think you're going to have to come on to the UX side before you could go to the product side. Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah. Because essentially you usually don't start in a strategic role. You start as a, you know, BAPO, yeah, and then go up to PM and then go into strategy. And then you become a, you go from like a tactical PM to like a strategic PM, yeah, goes with like your layers in the organization. People don't usually hire, you know, a two, somebody who has a few years experience as a strategist with no other role. Yeah. Yeah. And you don't just walk into those. Yeah. User research is a very strategic role, um, that can easily roll into a PM role. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a, that's good advice. That is really good advice. Well, Lauren, thank you. I'll, uh, I'll have to say my resume if I start, if I start applying other places and I'd love your opinion. So thank you. Have a good one. All right. See you later. Bye. Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

SEGMENTS WITH TIMESTAMPS
================================================================================

[00:00] So this has been a mess the past five minutes.
[00:05] So I'm sorry, let me read, read, read just, um, it is nice to reconnect.
[00:09] And I do want to, want to chat at some point, um, about just like life and work.
[00:13] The, the one, the thing that I really wanted to talk to you about is, um, Florence has
[00:20] its ups and downs.
[00:21] I'm really frustrated.
[00:22] I basically was told last week that there's no growth for me at Florence.
[00:27] So I'm evaluating new business ideas as well as like, just like, well, I'm like looking
[00:32] out into the, into the world to see what's there.
[00:34] But also, um, I have an idea that I'm exploring, um, so I think I thought you'd be a good person
[00:40] to talk to.
[00:41] Sure.
[00:42] Yeah.
[00:43] So the gist of the idea, uh, actually kind of comes from my work at Florence.
[00:46] We've done a ton of those discovery interviews with one one conversation that use our research
[00:50] and a lot of times it just goes into a page on confluence and the only times that other
[00:56] people use any of the work that we do is if, or that we have created is if we create
[01:01] some sort of insights from our own work and give it to them.
[01:05] So the idea is we can create a sort of, um, documentation system using AI, um, as well
[01:15] as a, like CRM, like a sale CRM specifically for user research so that it kind of automates
[01:22] all of the time, people to talk to, scheduling them, recording them, and then we take those
[01:29] transcripts to do like an AI analysis.
[01:32] Maybe we can create some persona based chatbots, uh, so that everyone on the company could
[01:36] say, you know, if you joined, like, we'll use for example, because we both know it is
[01:41] like, okay, someone doesn't understand clinical researcher or doesn't understand clinical
[01:45] research.
[01:46] We're here, you can go talk to a clinical researcher without having to actually go talk
[01:50] to someone, um, so we can kind of create these, um, reuse the data that we've already created.
[01:58] That exists already.
[02:00] Okay.
[02:01] Like, for like, maybe not exactly how you're envisioning and I have an idea because of
[02:05] like the communication, but dovetail's been around from, for, for quite a moment.
[02:10] Yeah.
[02:11] Um, and dovetail, um, basically it records with you tags, you who set up tags of like
[02:18] the keywords that are, that are important for, um, your industry or your research.
[02:26] And it will tag your, um, your, uh, research, uh, you know, practice whether it's a transcript
[02:35] or whether it's a video and it will automatically tag your research to win those keywords show
[02:40] up.
[02:41] Um, and, and, you know, so, so you can go and, so you're saying, okay, well, I'm looking
[02:48] for, um, uh, research on source documentation.
[02:54] So it will actually show you every time source documents comes up in any research that you
[02:59] have done.
[03:00] Gotcha.
[03:01] Okay.
[03:02] So that does it, it searches through those transcripts and like we'll pull those things
[03:06] up.
[03:07] It automatically tags it for you.
[03:08] Oh.
[03:09] Okay.
[03:10] And then it doesn't search through the transcripts as well.
[03:12] Or wow.
[03:13] Okay.
[03:14] Moving our competitive analysis, dovetail seemed like it was more about retrieval, right?
[03:20] But not necessarily the analysis or like it couldn't, does it do any sort of like semantic
[03:27] analysis?
[03:28] Like, Oh, you talked to these people and this is, these are the major things that they're
[03:30] saying.
[03:31] That one doesn't, there's a new one coming out AI base that does that more.
[03:36] And I don't remember the name of it, but I just saw it and I was going to send it to
[03:41] my head of research, cause we just got dovetail approved and I was going to set it to head
[03:46] of research, but he already doesn't like me.
[03:49] So I, why I find that hard to believe because, um, he thinks that I am, um, uh, he thinks
[04:04] that I am impeding on his expertise.
[04:09] And it's just the way that he has never, he, he from his, uh, training is not a designer.
[04:18] He is by training a project manager and had worked on construction project management
[04:22] for, for a great number of years.
[04:24] He has been with the company for over 15 years, um, he learned user research and he's good
[04:32] at very structured user research.
[04:34] Um, I don't have any problem with him, but I don't think he understands the overlap and
[04:41] the, um, how in the collaboration of it, I think he's a little bit more of the mind
[04:48] that he's in charge.
[04:49] And I also think that he's been there a really long time.
[04:51] So he doesn't like, I think he's also very territorial.
[04:55] Yeah.
[04:56] So that's a hand problem, not a me problem.
[04:58] Yeah.
[04:59] That's okay.
[05:00] I would have assumed that anyone who wouldn't have liked it would have been more of a, of
[05:05] them problems.
[05:06] And I don't have a problem with him, but he's, but, but also for somebody so, uh, research
[05:12] minded and research focused who's, who claims to be very unbiased, he's extremely biased.
[05:21] So is the user, what, I guess like, what's the breakdown of the types of user research
[05:25] that you're doing?
[05:26] What percent is like one on one conversations versus like surveys versus like usability
[05:32] tests or beta tests, you do it all of them.
[05:35] All of it.
[05:36] We have a team.
[05:37] You have a team to do it.
[05:38] What, uh, give more researchers.
[05:41] We do, we do market analysis.
[05:43] We do V O O V O C. Um, we, yeah, we do competitive analysis.
[05:49] We do, um, uh, we even have like scorecards.
[05:52] So we can look at all the competitors and have scorecards for each of the competitors.
[05:56] Like, yeah, we're kind of doing it all.
[05:59] Um, and do you, do you have a good idea of like how many people you guys are talking
[06:05] to for the like one on one, uh, our researchers talk to any, but anywhere between, they do,
[06:13] they do a standard V O O cross cross company, uh, monthly between the three different sets
[06:19] of, we have SMB, which is not exactly SMB because it's actually just small business medium
[06:25] is actually separate, even though they call small SMB it drives me correct.
[06:30] Um, so it's basically SMB mid market and then like, um, the, the large, I forget what we
[06:38] call the, the larger, um, yeah.
[06:41] So we do V O O across everybody that works on those levels.
[06:47] Um, basically go through the roadmap, go through everything that they're hearing in
[06:52] a forum for, for all of product and research, uh, all of product, really, um, to hear what
[07:00] sales is saying.
[07:01] So we do it as a group.
[07:03] Um, it's more of like a, an internal community gathering of to hear what those researchers
[07:11] have found.
[07:12] No, it's the opposite.
[07:14] It is a, it is a, it is a, researchers running it, but it is a product hosted event where
[07:21] all of our, um, sales and customer representatives for each of those groups joins in to tell
[07:30] us what they're hearing.
[07:32] And those representatives are the sales reps or they're, they could be sales.
[07:36] They could be customer service.
[07:37] They could be like, so that's, it's also cross functional.
[07:40] It's literally like customer facing people coming in that deal with that market segment
[07:46] to tell us what they're hearing, um, you know, just in an open forum, you know, to, to,
[07:54] to, to basically as the eyes and the ears, um, so we know, if we need to dig into stuff,
[07:59] we know what to dig into and we know what to hear, what they're up against.
[08:03] And the, the researchers, like, are they also doing those one on one interviews in between
[08:09] those months and then providing that?
[08:11] So they can.
[08:12] So, so that's just like the standard cadence of just like standard VOO for the organization.
[08:17] Okay.
[08:18] On top of that, like we did, um, we were working on, um, there's a ticket called reduce confusion
[08:23] where we, you know, some of our workflows are a little funky.
[08:27] And so, and we know that they're funky.
[08:29] We kind of know how they're funky a little bit, but we wanted to get better ideas.
[08:32] So we had a VOO, which is voice of the organization.
[08:37] And then there's VOC, which is voice of the customer.
[08:39] I think those might be terms that people use in other companies to use.
[08:44] That's why I want to call them out because they're, I think they're good terminology.
[08:46] Yeah.
[08:47] Um, so we do, we can do like small, like focus group VOs.
[08:51] So we were talking about like our saved searches, which essentially is safe filter set.
[08:56] Um, and tagging is very confusing in our system.
[08:59] So we did a, we did a VOO just around that topic.
[09:03] So we'll have one off ones with a small group of people that deal with maybe that
[09:08] functionality and also do additional research to do deep dive on a subject.
[09:14] We can do that talk and we do it all the time.
[09:16] Um, on top of that, we will also do VOC, um, because we don't want to just listen to
[09:22] our VOO.
[09:23] Okay.
[09:24] And the V, uh, your VOCs, are they, are those typically ad hoc as well?
[09:32] Or are they on a cadence?
[09:33] They're, they're on an initiative.
[09:35] So we'll have a ticket, you'll, I'll, I'll tell a researcher what I want researched.
[09:40] Um, they will, and then I will work with them to create a field guide and then they will
[09:44] go and conduct a research and invite me into the research that they conduct.
[09:48] Uh, do you know if they, how like, do you know how they find the people that they're
[09:54] going to talk to?
[09:55] And do you?
[09:56] Gain site.
[09:58] What do you mean insight?
[09:59] Gain site.
[10:00] We use gain site, not, so you use Pendo.
[10:02] So gain site.
[10:03] We just get it right, get them right from gain site.
[10:05] And the gain site is product data.
[10:07] Okay.
[10:08] Uh, okay, get, uh, and what they, what we do is we have, we have an ongoing thing within
[10:16] our products help us with research.
[10:18] We're allowed to give an Amazon gift card.
[10:21] People don't do it for the gift card.
[10:23] Honestly, nobody really cares.
[10:25] Um, I've had, we've had people just tell, tell us to keep it like, yeah, I, I don't,
[10:31] I wouldn't put too much stress on that because nobody's doing user research for that $10
[10:35] gift card.
[10:36] Yeah.
[10:37] In, in our competitive analysis, there's a, there's a company called user research.
[10:41] And you literally just pay that 50 bucks for every interview.
[10:44] And like we were having the conversation of like, do people actually like, like, what
[10:49] makes a good use, a good research subject?
[10:52] And then also like, why do, like, why do they find value in it at Florence?
[10:56] People don't really care about like we've given, find our Starbucks gift cards.
[10:59] People, they don't, they don't give a shit or like, we've tried to give money, but they
[11:03] just want to make the product better for them.
[11:06] It doesn't work for SaaS.
[11:07] It doesn't matter for SaaS.
[11:08] Yeah.
[11:09] And so when you're, if you have a direct to consumer product, that $50 makes a difference
[11:15] and you're going to get, and you're also going to get a lot of, um, low level, um, users
[11:21] that probably don't use your product.
[11:23] I'm going to give you an example.
[11:25] So in between jobs, several years ago, I did, um, I was a extra for different movies and
[11:31] stuff.
[11:32] So, when you go on that, but there's people who are like professional extras and they're
[11:37] not all people who want to be actors.
[11:39] Some of them just like the flexibility to just want to work when they want to and turn
[11:42] it down when they want to.
[11:43] Yeah.
[11:44] So, or they just can't get another job.
[11:47] So a lot of these people while they're, they're sitting there, will go on to Nielsen and do
[11:52] surveys for money, uh, so, and, and these are people who may not be the product users
[12:00] and also may not be, I, but they're doing it to get that 20, $50, um, that totally makes
[12:10] sense.
[12:11] So, yeah.
[12:12] So just to give you an idea of, but I think B2B SaaS, even B2C SaaS, I just don't.
[12:19] Do you talk to, I would agree with all that, do you, um, only, or I guess your researchers
[12:24] only ever talk to users or do they ever talk to non-users who may be using similar products?
[12:30] Um, it's usually users, but all of our users are not, um, buyers.
[12:40] So our product is free for a lot of users and a lot of our users don't aren't going to buy.
[12:46] We will talk to all users.
[12:47] So it's, which I think that makes, gives that a little bit because, so basically like,
[12:53] they're not all, um, fans of ours.
[12:57] Uh, is the reason why I say that, because the buyers are typically fans of you.
[13:03] The buyers have a reason to be in there.
[13:05] The users are not, are not always fans of ours because like, we do a lot of heavy marketing,
[13:11] which I think actually is not great for us.
[13:14] Um, I think we, we, we hit them over the head with marketing and it's, it's, it's not great.
[13:19] And we, our onboarding experience was a 10 step process, which was awful.
[13:25] Yeah.
[13:26] And the thing is, is that they may be going through that 10 step process just to get an
[13:30] invitation to bid on a project.
[13:32] Mm.
[13:33] Okay.
[13:34] Like the person, the person who's just getting an ITB who's going to use us once, yeah, the
[13:39] log to create an account just because this guy sent me a project.
[13:43] Yeah.
[13:44] Just, just, just, just email it to me.
[13:46] Like I don't care, you know, download it, like, yeah, are there a, when you said that
[13:55] project plan to your research, is there ever times where they say, hey, we don't have
[13:58] people to talk to or, or we're, we're struggling to get enough.
[14:02] Um, they, they, we have more of an issue of them not showing up and just being busy.
[14:08] Um, I, I don't know that they, they, they have that much of an issue not getting research
[14:15] subjects.
[14:16] I think, I think Florence puts more, uh, throttles us more than they should.
[14:22] I also don't think Florence has the access to the data they need to know who the customers
[14:25] are.
[14:26] Yeah.
[14:27] A little bit of both.
[14:30] I think CS throttles that information.
[14:33] And I think, you know, yeah, and I don't think that's necessarily a unique problem.
[14:38] But I consider that a management decision problem more than a, um, functional problem.
[14:44] Yeah.
[14:45] So you, you said you just got dovetail.
[14:48] Um, we're guiding it.
[14:50] We're getting ducktail and we're getting maze maze.
[14:53] Okay.
[14:54] Uh, what's it?
[14:55] What is maze?
[14:56] I mean, um, I almost used it at, uh, at, uh, at, uh, at cognitive too.
[15:00] It is, um, for user testing for, um, product testing.
[15:05] Okay.
[15:06] So I'm wondering, I guess what I, um, what I'm curious is like the way that I see the
[15:13] user research world is like, there's like the qualitative stuff that you can do typically
[15:18] in surveys, not every organization has like an established user research work.
[15:23] Right.
[15:24] Yes.
[15:25] But, uh, I got to say you think they do most like honestly, ours was very, ours was not,
[15:32] um, you know, we didn't really have one nor was it really, um, nor will they really supportive
[15:39] of us being one?
[15:41] Oh, why was not supportive of Florence for me?
[15:46] Yeah.
[15:47] Yeah.
[15:48] I think, um, if you don't have one, that is why.
[15:52] Yeah.
[15:53] I don't, I, again, I think it's more of, I think it really falls into a management decision
[15:59] that they are, they do not welcome feedback, not that people cannot get feedback.
[16:04] I think that is the problem.
[16:06] Yeah.
[16:07] Okay.
[16:08] Cause anybody can do user research.
[16:11] It does not have to come from UX.
[16:13] It does not have to come from product.
[16:16] Um, if you want feedback, the customer experience people could be, could be easily doing all
[16:23] the research you need in a small organization.
[16:26] Yeah.
[16:27] I, it's interesting.
[16:28] I think that what I hear from other, what I've heard from other people that I've interviewed
[16:32] is there's like a couple categories of like one, it's hard to, if you're, especially it's
[16:36] smart companies, maybe this is kind of the outcome of what our conversation is.
[16:39] Like, if we approach a point where a company gets large enough, that dovetail makes sense.
[16:44] Is dovetail pretty expensive?
[16:46] Do you know?
[16:47] I don't think it is.
[16:48] Actually.
[16:49] Let me check.
[16:50] And I, I will try to look up that other, that new AI one, because actually to me, it
[16:55] looked better than dovetail.
[16:56] Was it insight seven?
[16:58] No.
[16:59] Okay.
[17:00] Uh, yeah, um, let me see, pricing, what is dovetail's pricing?
[17:12] Uh, it's free for like a single user, uh, oh, you get one project, one channel unlimited
[17:22] users.
[17:23] So, so professional is $29 a month.
[17:26] Okay.
[17:27] So yeah, not that expensive.
[17:28] It's not expensive.
[17:29] Yeah.
[17:30] Okay.
[17:31] Um, except for the enterprise one, who knows how expensive that is, but like if you're
[17:38] a small team, $29 is it, is it anything?
[17:42] Um, do you, I guess you're, you're going to get dovetail at some point.
[17:46] I'd be curious to hear how it, how it goes, uh, once you start using it.
[17:50] And then if there's, are there any other gaps, do you think in your user research that you
[17:55] had more access that would give you maybe more access to customer feedback or input?
[18:01] Um, yeah, I guess another thing too, is that like, we're using air table to.
[18:08] Hold all the information, which I also think that's helpful.
[18:11] I think that, um, uh, confluence is not, is not the place at all, but I think something
[18:20] like an air table or even like a notion.
[18:23] Yeah.
[18:24] Um, you know, it's just inherently better.
[18:28] And if you actually have dovetail, I don't know if it integrates or not, but even if it
[18:34] doesn't integrate, if you have them tagged in the same manner, yeah, you've solved so
[18:39] many of your problems, 100%, 100%, well, this has been helpful.
[18:44] I really appreciate you giving me your feedback.
[18:46] Yeah.
[18:47] Yeah.
[18:48] Um, let me look at my notes real quick.
[18:50] There's any other questions, um, is dovetail going to help you do like, as you said, no,
[18:57] it won't do any of the analysis to help like determine?
[19:01] I don't know how much of it it does.
[19:04] Um, let me see.
[19:07] It does integrate with tools.
[19:09] So I guess it is going to, um, and it does track feedback channels is a new way to transform
[19:15] feedback into powerful insights, uncover trends, predict issues and build products people love.
[19:21] So they are doing that.
[19:25] That is a new feature that's coming out for them.
[19:28] Um, do you know, if.
[19:31] If your marketing team would potentially use something like dovetail with your data in
[19:36] it so they could test like messaging and like, say, already do that.
[19:40] They already do that.
[19:41] Okay.
[19:42] Yeah.
[19:43] Marketing doesn't, marketing is as always more nimble than product.
[19:48] So, um, marketing does, uh, test messaging and, and, and does quite about a lot of A, B
[19:55] and ABC, um, uh, experiments for, with different messaging and with different, um, kind of
[20:02] layouts.
[20:03] Do you feel?
[20:04] Yeah.
[20:05] That, that makes sense.
[20:06] Do you know if, do you think it could be faster for them if they had access to the data
[20:10] that you'll have in dovetail?
[20:12] We have gain sight.
[20:13] That's the thing is that like, I feel like where you're missing, uh, a, a connection
[20:18] point is actually the fact that you have bad analytics.
[20:20] Yeah.
[20:21] Totally.
[20:22] I think you have, if you have your analytic platform hooked up with your database with
[20:30] your, like, if you have these things working together, you're, you have a much better view
[20:35] of what's happening.
[20:36] Yeah.
[20:37] Florence were, Florence were very, we were very, um, uh, hampered bias and it all comes
[20:45] up like our own shitty data to begin with.
[20:48] Yeah.
[20:49] Yeah.
[20:50] You don't even want to hear the shit that's been happening this past year and you don't
[20:54] even want to know, uh, no, this is very good.
[20:57] And this is, I mean, this is why I'm doing these calls is to know, it's to learn what
[21:00] I don't know.
[21:01] So I really appreciate it.
[21:02] Um, let me see, uh, oh, could you just look up the, could you send me the, the link for
[21:11] maze and that other thing that you, yeah, I'll look for the other thing maze.
[21:15] I can probably give it to you right now, um, these, um, yeah, this also makes you wonder
[21:23] like maybe like I'm thinking about this, obviously from what Florence is the only like
[21:27] software company that I really have experience at.
[21:29] Yeah.
[21:30] I think about this from the Florence perspective, like maybe we just have to segment this specifically
[21:35] for teams that have mature products, uh, I feel like I feel like even, I feel like nobody's
[21:45] data is great.
[21:46] I feel like Florence is particularly terrible.
[21:47] Yeah.
[21:48] It is uniquely terrible.
[21:50] Yeah.
[21:51] And the fact that they have not done more to make it not terrible, um, is going to sink
[21:59] them.
[22:00] And I, that's, that's been apparent for a long time and they're not making good decisions.
[22:05] Yeah.
[22:06] Yeah.
[22:07] No, 100%.
[22:08] It's like, I agree that we do way too much marketing, but it's like, that's like the
[22:12] biggest, I, in my opinion, like the biggest problem is like marketing makes everyone direct
[22:16] the cool aid and like for some reason, like we have such a great brand across the industry.
[22:21] I asked a random person like who's the best product, who makes the best products in clinical
[22:25] research.
[22:26] They're like, Oh, Florence by a mile and I'm like, how is Florence the best product in
[22:30] clinical trials?
[22:31] When we have such stuff, it's, it's awful.
[22:35] And, and it's funny too, is I think you really need to have, I talked, I had my annual visit
[22:40] with my nephrologist today.
[22:42] And I had mentioned Florence and he was like, Italy, he's like never heard of it.
[22:46] And, and he's, I mean, he, he conducts, he's, he, he is an investigator, ah, like he did,
[22:54] like he, I had the drug, I take a lot of stuff.
[22:58] He ran that study with, um, one of the other, um, with the lead researcher, but he actually
[23:03] led the study, yeah, at Emory, and, um, he's done several other trials and he's got a
[23:10] relationship with Bristol Myers.
[23:13] Interesting.
[23:14] And they're not a client.
[23:16] So I just thought that was interesting.
[23:18] Yeah.
[23:19] I'm just, just saying.
[23:20] No, you're so right.
[23:21] I'm trying to get off this partnership as soon as possible.
[23:24] Uh, you know, I think should position just a little place, um, I would position yourself
[23:32] as a user researcher and not as a product person.
[23:35] Okay.
[23:36] Because I think that's where you're, I think that in reality is what your skill said.
[23:40] What, like, what your job is.
[23:42] Yeah.
[23:43] Um, yeah, I think product strategy is going to be, is going to not resonate given your
[23:49] experience with other companies.
[23:52] I think user research, you will actually, um, have a lot of experience in actually, um,
[23:59] the very, very, um, uh, you know, people would be, you know, what it be, should I use, like
[24:08] user research, or should I use voice of the customer?
[24:12] User research is the category.
[24:13] Um, voice of the customer is, is, is one of the types of research you do.
[24:17] Uh, okay.
[24:18] Okay.
[24:19] Yeah.
[24:20] And if, if you have questions, I'm happy to like help you.
[24:22] Yeah.
[24:23] But I think, I think you are, you're, you're a researcher.
[24:29] Yeah.
[24:30] More like you, and you, and you have good experience and research and, you know, you, and you're,
[24:35] yeah, that's, that's to me, you're right.
[24:38] I said that to, I said that to Andrew last week, she made a pretty, uh, insulting comment.
[24:43] That was like, how do you feel that you don't have any of like transferable skills, like
[24:47] any deep expertise in anything going to find your next job?
[24:50] And I was like, well, I would argue I had deep expertise in user research.
[24:53] Yeah.
[24:54] I, I, I think you could easily, I would, I would position your current position as a
[24:59] user researcher role and just try to transition that into another one.
[25:03] Yeah.
[25:04] I think you need something in between, if you want to go into product management.
[25:10] Okay.
[25:11] Okay.
[25:12] I think you, I think you can, um, but I think I actually think you're going to have to come
[25:17] on to the UX side before you could go to the product side.
[25:20] Gotcha.
[25:21] Yeah.
[25:22] Yeah.
[25:23] Because essentially you usually don't start in a strategic role.
[25:29] You start as a, you know, BAPO, yeah, and then go up to PM and then go into strategy.
[25:35] And then you become a, you go from like a tactical PM to like a strategic PM, yeah, goes
[25:41] with like your layers in the organization.
[25:44] People don't usually hire, you know, a two, somebody who has a few years experience as
[25:50] a strategist with no other role.
[25:52] Yeah.
[25:53] Yeah.
[25:54] And you don't just walk into those.
[25:55] Yeah.
[25:56] User research is a very strategic role, um, that can easily roll into a PM role.
[26:04] Yeah.
[26:05] Yeah.
[26:06] No, that's a, that's good advice.
[26:08] That is really good advice.
[26:10] Well, Lauren, thank you.
[26:11] I'll, uh, I'll have to say my resume if I start, if I start applying other places and
[26:15] I'd love your opinion.
[26:16] So thank you.
[26:17] Have a good one.
[26:18] All right.
[26:19] See you later.
[26:20] Bye.
[26:26] Okay.
[26:27] Bye.
[26:28] Bye.
[26:29] Bye.
[26:30] Bye.
[26:31] Bye.
[26:32] Bye.
