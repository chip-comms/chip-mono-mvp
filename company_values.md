# Our Company Values

## Leading with Curiosity

Approach every challenge, conversation, and project with genuine curiosity rather than assumptions. Ask "why" and "what if" before jumping to solutions. When you encounter something you don't understand, treat it as an opportunity to learn rather than a problem to avoid. In meetings, be the person who asks the clarifying question others are thinking but not saying. When someone proposes an idea different from yours, get curious about their perspective before defending your own. This means doing research, seeking diverse viewpoints, and staying humble about what you don't know.

## Having Fun

Create an environment where work is energizing, not draining. This doesn't mean every moment is a party—it means finding joy in collaboration, celebrating wins (big and small), and not taking ourselves too seriously when things go wrong. Inject humor into tough situations. Organize team activities that help people connect as humans, not just coworkers. When the work gets intense, be the person who brings levity without diminishing the stakes. Remember that sustainable high performance comes from people who actually enjoy what they do and who they do it with.

## Radical Candor

Give feedback that's both direct and kind—caring personally while challenging directly. When you see something that could be better, say it clearly and promptly rather than letting it fester. This means having uncomfortable conversations with respect and empathy. When receiving feedback, listen to understand rather than to defend. Assume positive intent, but don't sugarcoat tough messages. Be specific about what you observed and why it matters. The goal isn't to be nice or to be brutally honest—it's to help each other grow through truth-telling rooted in genuine care.

## Ownership Mentality

Act like an owner, not a renter. This means taking initiative without waiting for permission, thinking long-term instead of short-term, and caring about outcomes beyond your immediate responsibilities. When you see a problem, don't wait for someone else to fix it—step up, even if it's outside your job description. Take responsibility for mistakes rather than deflecting blame. Make decisions that benefit the company's future, not just your team's quarterly goals. Ask "what's best for our customers and our mission?" before "what's easiest for me?" This mentality means you're building something, not just completing tasks.

## Embrace the Struggle

Recognize that meaningful work is inherently difficult, and that's where growth happens. Don't shy away from hard problems—lean into them. When a project feels overwhelming, break it down and tackle it piece by piece rather than avoiding it. Share your struggles openly with your team; vulnerability builds trust and often reveals that others face similar challenges. View setbacks as data points, not failures. When things get tough, ask "what can I learn from this?" instead of "why is this happening to me?" This value isn't about glorifying suffering—it's about building resilience and finding meaning in the climb, not just the summit.
